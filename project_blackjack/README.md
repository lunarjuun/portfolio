# √Örsoppgave V√•r 2025 ‚Äî Blackjack Web Game üÉè
### Dominic Aramis, 2IMB

A browser-based Blackjack game built using JavaScript, ran on a Python server.
My project was created with the goal of learning about server hosting, JavaScript, and databases using MariaDB.

## Credits
The source code for the majority of the game (primarily JS) was made by Kenny Yip Coding on Youtube. But I typed all the code myself, I just followed the tutorial step by step, and made some small changes. I coded everything else myself (HTML, CSS, Python)

## Equipment Used
- Any machine that runs Linux (I use Raspberry Pi and I'm using Ubuntu Desktop OS)
- MariaDB/MySQL (Database)
- Git, Python and Pip installed

This project was made locally on my PC and it runs on a Linux machine.

## Documentation/Process

March: The start of the project. I was at odds with if I should go through with making a game for my final project, but I felt like I would be dishonoring my own wishes if I didn't. I learned a surprising bit of JS while I was making this project. I also tried introducing Flask during the month of March but it didn't work out so well.

April: Testing some miscellaneous things on the index like adding an alert, a button that plays audio, etc. I continued to work on the game and I completed it the same month. I was also in the process of setting up a connection to my MariaDB. In April is also when I was working on documentation by updating my FAQ.md and my README.md.

May: Continued to update my README.md and added a tutorial for Blackjack in the form of HowToPlay.md. Then I returned to the game and changed the look of things for better contrast. Towards the end of my project, I had to push a lot of small, insignificant changes so that I could Pull it onto my Raspberry Pi. To conclude the project, I established a connection between the form on the website and the database, saving my first name and score. 

## Target Audience
Since my project is a game, my target audience is people who are looking for something to pass the time. Reason simply being that I‚Äôm one of them. I enjoy card games, but I don‚Äôt always have a deck of cards available ‚Äî so I‚Äôve tried to solve that problem with this project; making it on the web instead of needing to download an app just to play.

## Accessibility/UU and UX
I‚Äôve made sure that all text is easy to read and that the background has good contrast with the text. I also use fitting text sizes on both the landing page and the game page. I also did media queries for both sites.

## Legality
The images used for the card deck are open-source, but the dealer is my original character. I also drew the sprites.

## Languages Used
- HTML (Elements)
- CSS (Styling)
- Python (Hosting)
- Javascript (Functionality)
- SQL (Database)
