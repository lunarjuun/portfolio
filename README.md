# My Coding Portfolio - Dominic Aramis
----

This is a cohesive and encompassing portfolio covering a wide variety of my expertise in coding, ranging from HTML, CSS, some JS, some Python, and SQL (Linux). This was made to give an idea of what my coding skills look like, and using different compatible coding languages to make a full-fledged project.
