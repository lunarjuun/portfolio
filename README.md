# My Coding Portfolio - Dominic Aramis
----

This is a cohesive and encompassing portfolio covering a wide variety of my expertise in coding, ranging from HTML, CSS, some JS, some Python, and SQL (Linux). This was made to give an idea of what my coding skills look like, and using different compatible coding languages to make a full-fledged project.

### GameXChange
A week-long project from my second year of high school where I redesigned the appearance of an entire website for a hypothetical client. I received very positive feedback from my teachers for the project and being able to fill all the criteria, from user accessibility to functionality.

### Blackjack
My exam turn-in was a simple Blackjack game where I showed all my capabilities. The game's code is open source, but the HTML, SQL, Python and CSS are all written and configured by me, as well as the external database that saves the player's name and score.

### My Website
A small, personal portfolio.

### Devoid Fashion
A hypothetical shop website I made for a made-up brand.
