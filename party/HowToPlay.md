# How To Play: Blackjack
Blackjack is a chance-based, strategy card game using all 52 cards excluding the Joker. 

### Objective
To win against the dealer in blackjack, you have to get as close as you can to 21 without going over. This is determined by the value of the cards you are dealt and the ones you happen to draw.

### Card Values
2-10: Value reflected by the displayed number.

J-Q-K: Face cards are all worth 10.

A: The Ace is either worth 1 or 11, depending on if you exceed 21 with the cards you already have. The code already accounts for this possibility, and converts the value of the Ace to 1 automatically once you surpass 21.

### How The Game Works
When you play my coded version of Blackjack, you simply just need to beat the dealer, so bets aren't a thing here. (yet)

The dealer will always start at around 16-17 and they will have an extra card that is upside down, called the Hole card. When you're dealt a hand, you have to see how much your hand is worth, and if it's worth to Hit or Stay. 

### > Hit
The concept of "Hitting" means drawing another card for the chance to get closer to 21 and hoping you dont go above that. The closer you are to 21 with your starting cards, the less you should choose to Hit.
### > Stay
Contrarily "Stay" means you'd rather keep your cards than risk a Bust through choosing to Hit and going over 21. If you're close to 21 and don't want to go over it, it's best to choose to Stay instead.
